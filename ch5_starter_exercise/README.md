In this chapter, I learned that the widget tree is the result of nested widgets. As the number of
widgets increases, the widget tree expands quickly and lessens code readability and manageability.
I call this the full widget tree. To improve code readability and manageability, you can separate widgets using widget method or widget class.
into their own widget class, creating a shallower widget tree. In each app, you should strive to
keep the widget tree shallow.
